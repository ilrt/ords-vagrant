# An attempt to get ORDS working quickly #

This will build and start ORDS using vagrant, for testing purposes.

## Prerequisites ##

1. git
2. Vagrant https://www.vagrantup.com

## Starting ##

    $ vagrant up
    ... lots of output ...

## Issues ##

Database isn't reset for tests, so reprovisioning will fail.
